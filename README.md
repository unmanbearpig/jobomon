# Jobomon

Work In Progress.

The idea is to aggregate job offers from multiple sources into a single feed, filter and rank them, maybe send notification emails about certain ones. So far it does none of these things.

It's an API host (and maybe later RSS provider) in Rails and a client in React+Redux if I don't abandon it before I finish it.

The choice or React+Redux is arbitrary, it would've worked just fine with regular server-side rendering.

# TODO
- Add filters to feeds
- Ability to use feeds as sources for other feeds
