We&#039;re looking to find a programmer(s) or team, that can help create this application with us. Please only bid if you&#039;re capable of creating a product like this, and responsible enough to manage yourself/team, do good work, follow design specs and functionality requirements, and just generally be pleasant and reliable. <br /><br />
Job description:<br />
Responsive Web Application that allows locale storage with HTML 5, sharing via short URL, upgrade options that include additional URLs and reporting features on assets.<br /><br />
Web development project type:<br />
New product<br /><br />
Client side or server side development:<br />
Both<br /><br />
Specific programming languages desired:<br />
We appreciate your thoughts and experiences, but here are the basics. If you have a better idea, then please feel free to share it.<br /><br />
PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Perl, Ruby on Rails:<br /><br />
Journey Tree:<br />
1.0 A - Maker, Upload image (YouTube link, png, etc.) and sends for review to the Approver<br />
2.0 B - Approver - Comments on Asset and sends to a team for review<br />
3.0 C - Reviewer - Votes on comments, Maker is notified<br /><br />
User B can leave a note, attach an asset to the note (img/pdf/doc/ppt/etc), commit their note to finished and then User A receives an email notifications of User B&#039;s assets and note.<br /><br />
The Link is set to expire.<br />
User A can set an expiration time for each asset;&nbsp;&nbsp;12hrs, 24hrs, x, x, etc., after upload. After the expiration time, the assets are deleted and removed from our servers. There are a few other paid features, but nothing complicated or unfamiliar to a seasoned team.<br /><br />
Transactions:<br />
The paid option requires user authentication, but remains anonymous on the front end. Paid option will be explained to the winner more clearly. We will most likely be using:<br />
https://www.wepay.com/<br /><br />
Hosting/Staging:<br />
We&#039;ll provide you with a staging area on our host Dreamhost acount. The application will be developed and reviewed on Dreamhost. We&#039;re happy to work with AWS, but you must also run a git repo, providing dumps for each milestone/track completion.<br /><br />
Emails:<br />
If you can create a secure email server, then great&mdash;if not, we&#039;ll be using<br />
https://www.mandrill.com/ or mailchimp<br /><br />
Additional comments:<br />
We appreciate your time, talent, and patience. Our budget is fixed. The design of the UI is completely code-driven, with minimal image assets. The framework will be responsive, as will the emails between User A and User B.<br /><br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A feature and functionality list will be sent to candidates once we&#039;ve selected a few to speak with.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />
We will also provide detailed Wireframes, Functional specs, and Design comps. We will be as thorough as possible, in order to not waste your time. But as usual, there are always little details that can missed.<br /><br />
Timeline:<br />

We&#039;re looking to find a programmer(s) or team, that can help create this application with us. Please only bid if you&#039;re capable of creating a product like this, and responsible enough to manage yourself/team, do good work, follow design specs and functionality requirements, and just generally be pleasant and reliable. <br /><br />
Job description:<br />
Responsive Web Application that allows locale storage with HTML 5, sharing via short URL, upgrade options that include additional URLs and reporting features on assets.<br /><br />
Web development project type:<br />
New product<br /><br />
Client side or server side development:<br />
Both<br /><br />
Specific programming languages desired:<br />
We appreciate your thoughts and experiences, but here are the basics. If you have a better idea, then please feel free to share it.<br /><br />
PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Perl, Ruby on Rails:<br /><br />
Journey Tree:<br />
1.0 A - Maker, Upload image (YouTube link, png, etc.) and sends for review to the Approver<br />
2.0 B - Approver - Comments on Asset and sends to a team for review<br />
3.0 C - Reviewer - Votes on comments, Maker is notified<br /><br />
User B can leave a note, attach an asset to the note (img/pdf/doc/ppt/etc), commit their note to finished and then User A receives an email notifications of User B&#039;s assets and note.<br /><br />
The Link is set to expire.<br />
User A can set an expiration time for each asset;&nbsp;&nbsp;12hrs, 24hrs, x, x, etc., after upload. After the expiration time, the assets are deleted and removed from our servers. There are a few other paid features, but nothing complicated or unfamiliar to a seasoned team.<br /><br />
Transactions:<br />
The paid option requires user authentication, but remains anonymous on the front end. Paid option will be explained to the winner more clearly. We will most likely be using:<br />
https://www.wepay.com/<br /><br />
Hosting/Staging:<br />
We&#039;ll provide you with a staging area on our host Dreamhost acount. The application will be developed and reviewed on Dreamhost. We&#039;re happy to work with AWS, but you must also run a git repo, providing dumps for each milestone/track completion.<br /><br />
Emails:<br />
If you can create a secure email server, then great&mdash;if not, we&#039;ll be using<br />
https://www.mandrill.com/ or mailchimp<br /><br />
Additional comments:<br />
We appreciate your time, talent, and patience. Our budget is fixed. The design of the UI is completely code-driven, with minimal image assets. The framework will be responsive, as will the emails between User A and User B.<br /><br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
A feature and functionality list will be sent to candidates once we&#039;ve selected a few to speak with.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />
We will also provide detailed Wireframes, Functional specs, and Design comps. We will be as thorough as possible, in order to not waste your time. But as usual, there are always little details that can missed.<br /><br />
Timeline:<br />
Phase one, outlined above, will be 1-7 wk process. It depends on your skills and how quickly you&#039;d like to work and finish the job. We respect your time and will work at your pace, provided we can meet our overall timeline. Please feel free to ask questions.<br /><br />
